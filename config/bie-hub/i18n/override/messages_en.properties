aus.traits.summary.caption=These traits are a sampler of those  available in AusTraits. The data presented here are summary statistics derived from all field-collected data on adult plants available from Traits. Since the data presented are derived from the wide variety of sources in AusTraits, both the numeric trait statistics (min, mean, max) and categorical trait summaries (frequency of each trait value) that have been merged together could include data collected using different methods. The values presented for this species may reflect a summary of data from one or many sources, one or many samples from one or many adult plants at one or many locations. They may therefore differ from those presented elsewhere on the platform and users are encouraged to download a spreadsheet of the full Traits data for this species via the download CSV button to view the accompanying details about the data sources before further use.
